## Basic Highlights of Our Projects

### Educational Pop-Ups

* Helps users learn about e-waste through various filter options and its harmful effects via videos and blogs. (Collaborated with NGOs and environmental activists)

### Location of Nearest E-Waste Facility Hub

* We will be registering all government-registered facility hubs on our website. Additionally, we will provide a secure platform for kabadiwalas (delivery boys) by registering them on our site.

### Credit Points and Rewards

* We will offer incentives for the e-waste users sell to us in the form of eco-scores, which they can redeem for cash and discount coupons. This incentive will encourage users to visit our site and engage in selling e-waste.

### Educational Purpose

* We will educate people through blogs, videos, and NGO collaborations about the harmful effects of e-waste.

## Why We Chose This Topic

* India is the 3rd largest producer of e-waste, but 95% is managed with primitive methods.
* The rare earth metals in e-waste are wasted, posing a future concern as India produces nearly 1.6 million metric tons annually. The market size for this is $3.8 billion.
* This initiative will help lower manufacturing costs for electronic items while providing kabadiwalas, who previously lacked recognition, with dignified employment.

## Key Points

* We aimed for a minimalist and creative UI to enhance user interaction.
* Our pages have been thoroughly tested to ensure the best appearance.
* The gamified experience, including a leaderboard section, will encourage continuous user engagement.
